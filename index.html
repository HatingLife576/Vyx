        <p>
          Vyx was made by Safyre Lyons, also known as 5LT online. Currently in early access with the full version not expected to release until at least 2020. Safyre works on this project as a hobby, not to earn any real value. Although not wanting to charge for the OS, she understands that she will need some money to finish the project and get a REAL website. Vyx is open source, and based of Debian (not with any Ubuntu). She downloaded Budgie as the desktop enviroment but is unsure if it worked or if it is something else (it does have the Gnome logo after all). Currently just a small little project any help would be appriciated. Safyre is to work on making 0.0.2 soon but to get her butt on it go <a href="https://www.paypal.me/SafyreDeveloper">HERE TO DONATE</a>, any donations welcome but not expected.<br><br>DEFAULT PASSWORD: Password1
